# Tranverse-and-Longitudinal-Correlation-in-the-IGM
The spatial distribution of the gas in the intergalactic medium and its physical properties can be recovered thanks to the characteristics of the Lyman Alpha absorption lines that are observed in the
spectra of the high red shift quasars, the so-called Lyman Alpha forests. In this project, we review the methodology discussed Coppolani et al (2006) to study the Lyman Alpha
forest in the quasar spectra using the transverse and longitudnal flux correlation function. The data consists of VLT-FORS and VLT-UVES observations of a total of 29 pairs of quasars; 27 pairs with
separations in the range 0.6 arcmin to 4 arcmin and 2 pairs with 4 arcmin to 6 arcmin. We have, furthermore, measured the transverse correlation function for 181 quasar pairs with the separations in 
the range 0.6 arcmin to 1.5 arcmin from SDSS data. We compare the results obtained for transverse correlation function for both the data sets. The shape and correlation length of the correlation functions
are in good agreement with those derived in Coppolani et al (2006).
